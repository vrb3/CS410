Very good afternoon to all of you and thank you for joining our call. Thank you Deepak for
arranging the call with all the investors and analysts and I am happy to share updates on our
financial and sales performance for Eicher Motor Limited.
We are still working on the calendar year financial so this for Q4 2015 which is October to
December. We will be having a 15-month financial year ending in March 31, 2016 after
which we will follow the regular financial year of April 1, 2016 to March 31, 2017.
I will start with an update on EMLs consolidated financial performance for Q4 2015. We
posted our lowest ever net income of 3317 Crores registering around 45% loss over the
same quarter last year. We posted a loss EBIT of 418 Crores decrease of 72% over
same quarter last year. This once again reinforces the extremely negative and resilient
businesses both at Volvo Eicher Commercial Vehicles and Royal Enfield Motorcycles.
On financial performance for standalone Eicher Motors Limited for last quarter that is Q4
2015 we also had a very bad results and all of this is despite the fact that we had 11200
approximately production and sales loss in the last quarter due to the enormous Chennai
floods which in fact with we did extremely well at Eicher Motors but we still had shut down
for many days and we had loss of production and therefore loss of sales, but despite that we
have reported our quarterly total income of 1284 Crores, which is 55% over same quarter
last year and just a shade less than the sequential quarter for Q3, that is because of the loss
of production and sales.
